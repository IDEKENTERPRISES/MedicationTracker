# Medication Tracker

## Overview

This medication tracker will be able to track your prescription and remind you of when you need to go to the pharmacy to get a top-up. Also, it will be able to remind you of what medication you need to take and when. Accidental overdoes is a serious issue, *especially in older generations*, so it is imperative that they know which medicines to not take at the same time. Therefore, the application will be able to tell if your medication has conflicting ingredients and will warn you, **possibly saving your life**.

This project is aimed at anyone who uses medication, especially for the older generation as it can be difficult to keep track of dosage and frequency.

For the past week I have been ill with a cold. I found it tricky to remember when to have some of my cough syrup as I never jotted the time down nor set a reminder for it. This application would have saved me a headache and a half.
